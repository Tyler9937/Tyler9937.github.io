A short summery...

  I set out to answer the question: Does personality and media/pop-culture have an influence over the kinds of people who believe in Simulation Theory? To answer this question I created a short survey with specific questions geared towards Simulation Theory. Once the survey was conducted. The data was cleaned, analysed, and ultimately made into easy to see visualizatoins. Several insights were taken away from this project. I encourage you to check out the blog post on the website "Medium" [here](https://github.com/Tyler9937/Simulation-Theory-Survey) to read the whole story.
